### Tic tac toe

Create a version of tic-tac-toe (Noughts and Crosses) which is playable in the web browser/device using which ever framework you wish.
The computer should make the correct moves to try to win the game.
For extra credit make a two player mode of the game where two people can play from separate browser windows.
